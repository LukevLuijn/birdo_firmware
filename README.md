# Birdo firmware

This prototype, named Birdo is a device used for patients with heart problems to help people with rehabilitation. Birdo is a physical device to give the patients insights into their data by using sound, motion and light experience. It helps to give the patients insight into their behaviour and thus helps with recovering. Since the doctor is not able to track the patients every day in their rehab period, Birdo helps!
